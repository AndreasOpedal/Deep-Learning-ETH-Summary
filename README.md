# Summary of Deep Learning, Fall Semester 2020

This is a summary / cheat sheet made for the exam for the course Deep Learning at ETH Zurich. Parts were contributed by [Cristy Guzman](https://github.com/CristyGuzman) and [Daphna Keidar](https://github.com/Daphiy). The template was adapted from a (highly recommended!) [summary for another ETH course](https://github.com/anklinv/Computational-Statistics-ETH-FS19).
